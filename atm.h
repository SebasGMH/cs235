        * This function return a string with all transactions (Withdrawals/Deposits) on seperate lines
        * Each transaction should be on their own line
        * Format:
        *       For all calls to getBalance: "Current Balance: <Balance amount at the time of the call>" 
        *       For all Deposits: "+ <Amount for Deposit>"
        *       For all valid Withdrawals: "- <Amount for Withdrawal>"
        *       For all invalid Withdrawals: "Invalid Withdrawal Amount: <Amount for invalid Withdrawal>"
        *       Note: The quotes are only there to show what the string should look like for each operation
        *             Replace the contents within <> with what it states
        *             Also note that the amount of lines in the string should equal the amount of total transactions before this function call 
        * Example:
        *       deposit(100);  // Returns 100
        *       deposit(200);  // Returns 200
        *       withdraw(100);  // Returns 100
        *       getBalance();   // Returns 100
        *       withdraw(1000); // Returns -1
        *       getTransactionString(); // Will return a string of all transactions
        * 
        *       Passing your string to std::cout should produce the following output:
        *       + 100
        *       + 200
        *       - 100
        *       Current Balance: 100
        *       Invalid Withdrawal Amount: 1000
        *
        *       NOTE: The last character of your string should be a new line unless you find no transactions
        *
        * @param  None
        * @return A String that displays all transactions on their own line
